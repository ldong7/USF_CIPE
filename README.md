Classified over 50,000 students as “graduate”, “withdraw” or “continue” with 86% accuracy, using random forest in R and 10-fold cross-validation

Discovered influential factors in student retention using logistic regression models

Cleaned and organized data related to retention and graduation of undergraduate students
